REPO_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert DevOps engineer. Your task is to analyze the provided repository
and identify all distinct services that need to be deployed.

First, review the repository map provided below to get an overview of the project structure,
key files, and important symbols.

{repo_map_str}

Based on this map and the content of relevant files (which you can request using the
'read_file_content' tool), identify the services. For each service, determine:
1.  `language`: The primary programming language of the service (e.g., "python", "javascript", "java").
2.  `language_version`: The specific version of the language, if identifiable (e.g., "3.9", "17", "ES2020").
3.  `service_type`: The type of the service. Must be one of: "backend-api", "backend-worker", "frontend", "full_stack".
4.  `framework`: The primary framework or library used, if any (e.g., "django", "react", "spring boot", "celery").
5.  `build_tool`: The build tool used for the service, if identifiable (e.g., "maven", "gradle", "npm", "webpack", "pip", "poetry").
6.  `infra_deps`: A list of infrastructure dependencies required by the service. For each dependency, specify:
    *   `dependency_type`: The type of the dependency. Must be one of: "database", "cache", "message_queue", "search_engine".
    *   `provider`: The specific provider of the dependency (e.g., "postgresql", "redis", "rabbitmq", "elasticsearch").
    *   `version`: The version of the dependency, if identifiable.

Return the information as a list of services.
* Read the dependencies list from files like `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, etc., to get an idea of potential frameworks and infrastructure dependencies.
* Do not rely on the repository map and dependency information alone; read relevant files such as entry points to figure out the services.
* Look for configuration files or code that initializes connections to databases, caches, message queues, or search engines.
* Read as many files as needed until you are sure about the service and infrastructure dependency details.
